Below is an algorithm and its C implementation for multiplying large numbers ranging from 512 bits to 65,536 bits, where the bit sizes are powers of 2. The algorithm employs the Toom-Cook 2-way (Toom-2) method, also known as the Karatsuba algorithm, recursively splitting the numbers until their size is 256 bits or less, at which point it switches to a schoolbook multiplication base case.

### Algorithm Description

The Toom-2 (Karatsuba) algorithm reduces the multiplication of two large numbers into three multiplications of smaller numbers, providing an asymptotic complexity of O(n^log₂3) ≈ O(n^1.585), which is more efficient than the O(n²) of schoolbook multiplication for large numbers. Here's the high-level approach:

1. **Input Representation:**
   - Numbers are represented as arrays of 64-bit limbs (type `uint64_t`), with the least significant limb first.
   - For a number with `n` bits, where `n` is a power of 2 between 512 and 65,536, the number of limbs is `m = n / 64`, which is also a power of 2 (since 64 = 2⁶).

2. **Recursive Splitting:**
   - For two numbers `a` and `b`, each with `m` limbs (where `m ≥ 8` for 512 bits), split each into two equal parts of `k = m / 2` limbs:
     - `a = a1 * B^k + a0`, where `B = 2^64`, `a0` is the lower `k` limbs, and `a1` is the upper `k` limbs.
     - `b = b1 * B^k + b0`, similarly.
   - Compute three products:
     - `p0 = a0 * b0`
     - `p1 = a1 * b1`
     - `p2 = (a0 + a1) * (b0 + b1)`
   - Combine the results: `result = p1 * B^(2k) + (p2 - p0 - p1) * B^k + p0`.

3. **Base Case:**
   - When the number of limbs `m` is 4 or fewer (i.e., ≤256 bits, since 4 * 64 = 256), use schoolbook multiplication to compute the product directly, producing a result of up to 8 limbs.

4. **Handling Intermediate Sizes:**
   - During recursion, the terms `(a0 + a1)` and `(b0 + b1)` may have `k + 1` limbs due to a carry. These are padded to a common size (the maximum of their limb counts) and multiplied recursively using the same algorithm.

5. **Combination:**
   - The intermediate products are aligned and combined with additions and subtractions, handling carries appropriately to produce the final result in `2m` limbs.

### C Implementation

The implementation includes helper functions for addition, subtraction, and schoolbook multiplication, culminating in the main `toom2_mul` function. Memory is managed dynamically within the recursive calls, though for production use, a preallocated workspace would improve performance.

#### Header and Definitions

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef uint64_t limb_t;  // 64-bit limb type
#define LIMB_BITS 64      // Bits per limb
#define BASECASE_LIMBS 4  // Threshold for schoolbook multiplication (256 bits)
```

#### Helper Function: Schoolbook Multiplication

Multiplies two numbers with arbitrary limb counts, used as the base case.

```c
void schoolbook_mul(limb_t *result, const limb_t *a, size_t a_limbs, 
                   const limb_t *b, size_t b_limbs) {
    size_t total_limbs = a_limbs + b_limbs;
    memset(result, 0, total_limbs * sizeof(limb_t));
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < a_limbs; i++) {
        limb_t carry = 0;
        for (size_t j = 0; j < b_limbs; j++) {
            __uint128_t prod = (__uint128_t)a[i] * b[j] + result[i + j] + carry;
            result[i + j] = (limb_t)prod;
            carry = (limb_t)(prod >> LIMB_BITS);
        }
        size_t k = i + b_limbs;
        while (carry && k < total_limbs) {
            __uint128_t sum = (__uint128_t)result[k] + carry;
            result[k] = (limb_t)sum;
            carry = (limb_t)(sum >> LIMB_BITS);
            k++;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Helper Function: Addition

Adds two numbers with `n` limbs, returning the carry.

```c
limb_t add_n(limb_t *result, const limb_t *a, const limb_t *b, size_t n) {
    limb_t carry = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        __uint128_t sum = (__uint128_t)a[i] + b[i] + carry;
        result[i] = (limb_t)sum;
        carry = (limb_t)(sum >> LIMB_BITS);
    }
    return carry;
}
```

#### Helper Function: Subtraction

Subtracts `b` from `a` (assuming `a ≥ b`), both with `n` limbs.

```c
void sub_n(limb_t *result, const limb_t *a, const limb_t *b, size_t n) {
    limb_t borrow = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        __uint128_t diff = (__uint128_t)a[i] - b[i] - borrow;
        result[i] = (limb_t)diff;
        borrow = (diff >> LIMB_BITS) ? 1 : 0;
    }
}
```

#### Main Function: Toom-2 Multiplication

Implements the recursive Toom-2 algorithm.

```c
void toom2_mul(limb_t *result, const limb_t *a, const limb_t *b, size_t limbs) {
    // Base case: use schoolbook multiplication for 256 bits or less
    if (limbs <= BASECASE_LIMBS) {
        schoolbook_mul(result, a, b, limbs, limbs);
        return;
    }

    // Split size
    size_t k = limbs / 2;  // Since limbs is a power of 2, k is integer

    // Allocate temporary storage
    limb_t *a_sum = malloc((k + 1) * sizeof(limb_t));
    limb_t *b_sum = malloc((k + 1) * sizeof(limb_t));
    limb_t *p0 = malloc(2 * k * sizeof(limb_t));
    limb_t *p1 = malloc(2 * k * sizeof(limb_t));
    limb_t *p2 = malloc(2 * (k + 1) * sizeof(limb_t));
    limb_t *t = malloc(2 * (k + 1) * sizeof(limb_t));

    // Compute a_sum = a0 + a1
    memcpy(a_sum, a, k * sizeof(limb_t));
    limb_t carry = add_n(a_sum, a_sum, a + k, k);
    a_sum[k] = carry;
    size_t a_sum_limbs = carry ? k + 1 : k;

    // Compute b_sum = b0 + b1
    memcpy(b_sum, b, k * sizeof(limb_t));
    carry = add_n(b_sum, b_sum, b + k, k);
    b_sum[k] = carry;
    size_t b_sum_limbs = carry ? k + 1 : k;

    // Determine size for p2 computation
    size_t sum_limbs = a_sum_limbs > b_sum_limbs ? a_sum_limbs : b_sum_limbs;
    if (a_sum_limbs < sum_limbs) a_sum[a_sum_limbs] = 0;
    if (b_sum_limbs < sum_limbs) b_sum[b_sum_limbs] = 0;

    // Recursive multiplications
    toom2_mul(p0, a, b, k);                    // p0 = a0 * b0
    toom2_mul(p1, a + k, b + k, k);            // p1 = a1 * b1
    toom2_mul(p2, a_sum, b_sum, sum_limbs);    // p2 = (a0 + a1) * (b0 + b1)

    // Compute t = p2 - p0 - p1
    // Pad p0 and p1 to match p2's size
    size_t p2_size = 2 * sum_limbs;
    limb_t *p0_padded = malloc(p2_size * sizeof(limb_t));
    limb_t *p1_padded = malloc(p2_size * sizeof(limb_t));
    memcpy(p0_padded, p0, 2 * k * sizeof(limb_t));
    memset(p0_padded + 2 * k, 0, (p2_size - 2 * k) * sizeof(limb_t));
    memcpy(p1_padded, p1, 2 * k * sizeof(limb_t));
    memset(p1_padded + 2 * k, 0, (p2_size - 2 * k) * sizeof(limb_t));

    sub_n(t, p2, p0_padded, p2_size);  // t = p2 - p0_padded
    sub_n(t, t, p1_padded, p2_size);   // t = t - p1_padded

    // Combine results: result = p0 + t * B^k + p1 * B^(2k)
    memset(result, 0, 2 * limbs * sizeof(limb_t));
    memcpy(result, p0, 2 * k * sizeof(limb_t));  // Lower part

    // Add t at position k
    carry = add_n(result + k, result + k, t, p2_size);
    size_t i = k + p2_size;
    while (carry && i < 2 * limbs) {
        __uint128_t sum = (__uint128_t)result[i] + carry;
        result[i] = (limb_t)sum;
        carry = (limb_t)(sum >> LIMB_BITS);
        i++;
    }

    // Add p1 at position 2k
    carry = add_n(result + 2 * k, result + 2 * k, p1, 2 * k);
    i = 4 * k;
    while (carry && i < 2 * limbs) {
        __uint128_t sum = (__uint128_t)result[i] + carry;
        result[i] = (limb_t)sum;
        carry = (limb_t)(sum >> LIMB_BITS);
        i++;
    }

    // Free temporary memory
    free(a_sum);
    free(b_sum);
    free(p0);
    free(p1);
    free(p2);
    free(t);
    free(p0_padded);
    free(p1_padded);
}
```

#### Usage Example

To multiply two 512-bit numbers:

```c
int main() {
    size_t limbs = 512 / LIMB_BITS;  // 8 limbs
    limb_t *a = malloc(limbs * sizeof(limb_t));
    limb_t *b = malloc(limbs * sizeof(limb_t));
    limb_t *result = malloc(2 * limbs * sizeof(limb_t));

    // Initialize a and b with values (example)
    for (size_t i = 0; i < limbs; i++) {
        a[i] = i + 1;  // Example: a = 1 + 2*B + 3*B^2 + ...
        b[i] = i + 2;  // Example: b = 2 + 3*B + 4*B^2 + ...
    }

    toom2_mul(result, a, b, limbs);

    // Use result (2 * limbs = 16 limbs, 1024 bits)
    // Free memory
    free(a);
    free(b);
    free(result);
    return 0;
}
```

### Notes

- **Correctness:** The code handles bit sizes that are powers of 2 (512, 1024, ..., 65,536 bits), splitting numbers until they reach 256 bits (4 limbs), as specified.
- **Efficiency:** Dynamic memory allocation is used for simplicity. For better performance, preallocate a workspace and pass it to `toom2_mul`.
- **Assumptions:** Input numbers have the same number of limbs, a power of 2, starting at 8 (512 bits) up to 1024 (65,536 bits).
- **Portability:** Uses `__uint128_t` for 128-bit arithmetic; ensure compiler support (e.g., GCC).

This implementation fulfills the requirement for large number multiplication using Toom-2 with a 256-bit schoolbook base case.
