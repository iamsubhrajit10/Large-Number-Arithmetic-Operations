The idea is to have a hierarchy of benchmarks, with benchmark results
computed for the entire "GMPbench", and for "GMPbench.app.mersenne",
"GMPbench.app.RSA", "GMPbench.app.RSA.encrypt", etc, separately.

For GMPbench 0.1, there are just three parts:

	[Multiply large numbers]
	base.multiply			128
					512
					8192
					131072
					2097152

	[Divide numbers of different sizes by small primes]
	base.divide			8192/32			preinv
					8192/64			preinv
					8192/128
					8192/4096
					8192/8064		clever
					131072/8192		barrett repeat
					131072/65536
					8388608/4194304		newton+barrett

	[Run the RSA encryption algorithm]
	app.RSA		encrypt/verify	512
					1024
					2048
			decrypt/sign	512
					1024
					2048


Result scores are computed as a geometric mean.  Please use the included
script runbench for running the benchmarks and computing benchmark scores.

Rules:

  1. If benchmark code is changed, results are invalid and should not be
     reported as GMPbench results.  Compilation parameters may be changed,
     as long as the same parameters are used for all GMP source files and
     for all benchmark files.
  2. If GMP source is changed, results should not be reported as GMPbench
     results unless the following three conditions are met:
     A. It is clearly stated that GMP was changed when reporting results.
     B. The changes are generic and reasonable and not specifically target
	towards improving some aspect singularly exercised by the benchmark
	suite.
     C. All rights to the changes are assigned to the Free Software
	Foundation prior to publication of the benchmark results.
  3. As long as these rules are followed, results may be freely used.
     Please also report results to the GMP developer's mailing list
     gmp-devel@swox.com.
  4. When reporting results, these data should be included:
     A. Machine type and model
     B. CPU type and clock frequency
     C. GMP version used
     D. Modifications as permitted above
     E. Compiler and compiler version used
     F. Compiler options used
  5. The benchmark suite should be used with GMP 4.1 or later.
